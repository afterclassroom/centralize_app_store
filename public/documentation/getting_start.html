<p>Our first version of the gotoClassroom API represents an exciting step forward towards making it easier for users to create and access their data. We created it so that you can build tools to better the education experience of our users.

	<h2>API TERMS OF USE</h2>
	Before you start using the API, we have a few guidelines that we'd like you to know. Please
	make sure to read the full <a href="#/documentation/term_of_use.html">API Terms of Use</a>. Here's a quick summary:<br>
<br>
1. gotoClassroom users own their media. It's your responsibility to make sure that you respect that right.<br>
2. You cannot use the gotoClassroom name in your application.<br>
3. You cannot use the gotoClassroom API to crawl or store users' media without their expressed consent.<br>
4. You cannot replicate the core user experience of www.gotoclassroom.com/api <br>
5. Do not abuse the API. Too many requests too quickly will deny you access.<br>
